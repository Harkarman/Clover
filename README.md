## Clover
Clover is a very basic social media web app. It is my first major Node.JS project, and as such is fairly rough around the edges.

## Features
- Login/sign-up via local authentication as well as Google OAuth.
- Edit user profile (add profile image, change name and email).
- Create and display posts, comments and likes.
- Add (via friend requests) and remove friends.
- Password reset using reset links.
- Chat with other users.

## Frameworks and libraries used
- Node.JS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Passport
- EJS
- Bootstrap
- Nodemailer
- Socket.io

## Instructions
- Clone repository.\
- Run npm install.\
- Create environment variables using the included .env.example file. (I highly recommend dotenv-flow.)
- Verify directory structure and create missing folders (namely "uploads").

## Features I might work on
- 1-to-1 chatting with friends.
- Posting images and videos.
- Authentication via API.
- Reactions like love, haha instead of the good old like.
